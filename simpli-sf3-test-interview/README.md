=========================

Hello few precisions to say,

Firstly, I was unsure on how about coding on the repository of the test so I just code on my directory and make a copy paste in one swoop on the repository github, so I didn't respect the order to commit every 30 minutes sorry
Secondly, for the test you just need to change to %inputData2% or %inputData3% instead of %inputData% in src\Danny\WorkBundle\Resources\config\services.yml
And lastly, I was not sure if there were any sheetstyle for the CSS so I just use bootstrap to make something correct

Anyway I hope the quality is good enough and if there is any detail that I can improve, just let me know.
